# Bounty-template

**To use the bounty_template.md file, you can follow these steps:**

1. Go to the repository where you have the bounty_template.md file.

2. Click on the "Use this template" button, which is located on the repository's main page. This will allow you to create a new repository that uses the bounty_template.md file as a starting point.

3. Give the new repository a name, and click the "Create repository from template" button.

4. Once the new repository is created, navigate to the bounty_template.md file and click the "Edit" button to begin customizing the file.

5. Modify the bounty_template.md file to fit your specific needs, including updating the title, problem description, scope, guidelines, evaluation criteria, rewards, submission process, and contact information as needed.

6. Once you have made your changes, commit the changes to the repository.

7. You can now share the repository with others and invite them to participate in the bounty by submitting solutions that meet the guidelines you have established.

By using the bounty_template.md file as a starting point, you can save time and effort in creating bounties and ensure that all bounties follow a consistent format and include all necessary information.
